# Synchronous-Data-Flow
an implementation of Synchronous Data Flow (SDF) in python

Synchronous Data Flow (SDF) is a restriction on Kahn process networks where the number of tokens read and written by each process is known ahead of time. In some cases, processes can be scheduled such that channels have bounded FIFOs. In this project, a program was written in Python that simulates SDF's way of working.
